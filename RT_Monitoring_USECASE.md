# üõé  RT-Monitoring-SecureEP-Umbrella-Notification-Incident - Use Case


### 1. Problem Statement

* When faced with an attack that generates multiple alerts in multiple consoles, it can be difficult to quickly recognize that these alerts are all part of a common attack campaign.
* Too many alerts can result in ‚ÄúAlert Fatigue‚Äù which leads to critical alerts being missed or overlooked
* Management requires a simple monitoring platform to keep them abreast of an evolving situation.

### 2. Solution

* Use SecureX Orchestration to assess, deduplicate and notify multiple alerts
* Organizations need to get timely notification of an attack campaign within a common messaging platform, regardless of:
  * the number of alerts
  * from which product they originate

* This objective is achieved through :

  * Continuous monitoring of Umbrella and/or Secure EP Security events (loop)
  * Near real time Incident creation and update (grouped by endpoint hostname, **no duplicate event**)
  * Near real time notification on new or updated incident (**no duplicate notification for same event occurring multiple times**)
  * Statistic tables
  
* **Design Overview**
