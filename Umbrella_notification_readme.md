### Use Case

* Receive a near real time notification on a new domain blobked by Umbrella
* Use SecureX Orchestration to periodically : 
  * Get new security event from last check
  * Notify in Webex Teams on new domains blocked seen for the first time in the organization
  * Generate a statistiv table with number of hits for each domain and current notification status
* This workflow can be trigger by a schedule to execute every X minutes
* A control mechnism avoid simultaneous multiples runs of the workflow to limit risk of duplicate notification for the same domain.

### Currently Supported Solutions

 * **Cisco Umbrella - Reporting V1 - Security Reports**
 * **Cisco Webex**

### Design

  * 1. Check if an other instance of the workflow is currently running (global variable "running state" : "True/False")
       1. Yes - Completed
       2. No - Run the workflow and set Global Variable "running state" to "True"
    2. Admin Tasks
       1. Webex : Get Bot Token from Global Variable and Search for notification room
       2. Date : Calculate current date and get Last event date from global variable
    3. Query Umbrella Security Activity Report (start date = Last event date / to-date = current date)
    4. New security Events ?
       1. No - Completed
       2. Yes - continue workflow execution
    5. For each entries in the security report, check if the domain exists in the Global statistics table
       1. if No :
          1. Notify in Webex Teams
          2. Add the domain to statistics table with Notified.= True and Hits = 1
       2. If yes and Notified = False (notifcation enable for the domain)
          1. Notify in Webex Teams
          2. Update row in statistics table with Notified.= True and Hits = Hits + 1
       3. If yes and Notified = True (notification disable)
          1. Update row in statistics table with Notified.= True and Hits = Hits + 1
    6. Admin
       1. Store last security event date in global variable
       2. Set running state to False

    * **Password**: **Umbrella Reporting API : API Key**
    
    * **Authentication option**: **Basic**
    
      

* Go to **"Targets"** and create the following accounts. If they already exists under a different display name and you can't rename or duplicate them, you will have to modify Target Criteria in the workflow.

  

  * **Cisco Umbrella Reporting V1**- Target 

    * **Target Type** set to **HTTP Endpoint**

    * **Dislay Name** set to **Cisco Umbrella Reporting v1**

    * **No Account Key** set to **false**

    * **No Account Key** set to **true**
    
    * **Protocol** set to **HTTPS**
    
    * **Host** set to **webexapis.com**
    
    * **Port** set to **443**
    
      

* Go to **Variables** and Create or verify global variables for your **Webex Token**
  
  * **Webex Token**
  
    * **Data Type** set to **Secure String**
    
    * **Display Name** set to **Webex Bot Token**
    
    * **Scope** set to **Global**
    
    * **Value** set to **"YOUR WEBEX BOT TOKEN"**
    
      
    
4. **Import the Workflow**

   

* Go to Workflows and **IMPORT** the following workflow from **SX-AO** (or import manually)

  * **Umbrella-Notification-Security-Events**

5. **Open and edit the imported workflow** 

* Adjust following **variables** to fit with your needs

  * **Webex Room Name** set to the **Webex room name used for notification**. Remember to add your BOT to this room

6. * **Validate** the workflow

     

7. At first run the workflow will use the date 2022-01-17T01:00:00-00:00. If you want to change this behavior you have to edit the global variable **"AO-Umbrella-Notification-lastevent_date"**
