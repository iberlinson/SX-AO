# ðŸ§½ Cisco Secure EP - Remove Inactive Endpoints


### 1. Problem Statement

* Your list of computers in Cisco Secure Endpoint may be polluted with inactive endpoints that are not seen connected over a long period of time. The reasons can be multiple (duplication, laptop update, deleted virtual machine ...) and they consume "seats" in your license

### 2. Solution

* Use SecureX Orchestration to : 
  * Identify endpoint with a last seen value over a given number of days (default 45)
  * Remove them from your computer list automatically or with a 2-Tiers approval
  * Notify
  
* This workflow can be trigger by a schedule to execute every day or X days

### 3. Design Overview

  * 1. Calculate Past date from delay
  * 2. Query Cisco Secure Endpoint to get the list of Computer with their hostname, last seen, GUID
  * 3. For each computer, compare last seen value with Calculated past date
  * 5. Store in a temporary table Hostname, GUID of endpoint to be removed
